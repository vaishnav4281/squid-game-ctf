# Squid Game-Themed CTF Website

This project is a Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge created for my college tech fest. The CTF features a hidden website inspired by the Squid Game theme. The participants need to explore the website and uncover hidden flags using various clues.

## Features
- **Squid Game Theme**: The website design and concept are inspired by the popular series Squid Game.
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Participants need to solve puzzles, click on hidden elements, and inspect code to find flags.
- **Web Technologies**: Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for an engaging user experience.

## How It Works
1. **Explore the Website**: Participants navigate through the website, looking for hidden clues.
2. **Inspect Elements**: Some flags are hidden in the source code, requiring participants to use developer tools.
3. **Solve Challenges**: Certain buttons or logos trigger flags to appear when clicked or interacted with.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the content of the website.
- **CSS**: For styling and creating the Squid Game-themed design.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity, animations, and dynamic flag-revealing logic.
